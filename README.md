- Chrome extension + web app that use OpenAI’s GPT to recommend the optimal credit card for any online purchase.  
- Dynamically builds LLM prompts from your database of cards & reward categories, so recommendations are always up to date.  
- Achieved a **4.01×** boost in simulated rewards ($212.44 vs. $52.94 on \$5,294.46 spent) across 100 checkout tests.

### 🔔 [Popup!](https://github.com/evanxliu1/popup)
**Cross-Platform Notification App** • May 2025

## 🚧 Work in Progress

### 📸 Crash Never  
[**Collision Prediction System**](https://github.com/your-username/crash-never) • June 2025 (WIP)  
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.10-blue) ![YOLO](https://img.shields.io/badge/YOLO-darkred) ![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-orange)  

- Analyzing 30+ hours of 720p dashcam footage to predict collisions early.  
- Combines YOLO object detection, SORT tracking, and a ResNet18+LSTM pipeline to model trajectories & relative velocities.  
- Testing across highway, urban, and adverse-weather scenes for robust real-world performance.
